This week's question:
Given two strings n and m, return true if they are equal
when both are typed into empty text editors.
The twist: # means a backspace character.

Example:

> compareWithBackspace("a##c", "#a#c")
> true      // both strings become "c"

> compareWithBackspace("xy##", "z#w#")
> true      // both strings become ""
